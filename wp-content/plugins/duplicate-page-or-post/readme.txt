That is why having the ability to duplicate content in WordPress is very useful. Similarly, for recordings, you may also need to work on old drafts and records added on the website. You can simply go into editing it and start working on the recording. However, such a solution is not always suitable. For example, another author may work on it.

There are many options that you can set for duplicating recordings using our plugin. For example, you can set prefix or sufix for copied pages. Or you can clone only the content or title. 

###  Here is the options list of our plugin

*   **Title sufix (sufix is the custom text after the title)**

After that click on save button. After you configured all options, open "All pages" or "All posts".
